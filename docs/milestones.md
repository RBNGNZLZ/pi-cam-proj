### **Project Overview**  
**Goal**: Face detection with Raspberry Pi 5, using a database to store recognized users.

### **Milestone 1: Setup and Initial Exploration**
**Sprint 1: Initial Setup and Environment**
- **Objective**: Get the Raspberry Pi 5 up and running.
  - Install the Raspberry Pi OS.
  - Set up Python, OpenCV, and necessary libraries for face detection.
  - Connect camera module to Pi and test basic video capture.

**Sprint 2: Basic Face Detection**
- **Objective**: Implement basic face detection.
  - Set up OpenCV for real-time face detection.
  - Test with a sample image or video stream.
  - Fine-tune the face detection settings for accuracy.

### **Milestone 2: User Registration and Database Integration**
**Sprint 3: Database Setup**
- **Objective**: Set up a database to store user data.
  - Choose a database system (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL).
  - Design the schema (e.g., user ID, name, facial features, and date of registration).
  - Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for users.

**Sprint 4: User Registration**
- **Objective**: Implement user registration with face capture.
  - Set up a function to capture faces and store facial data (using OpenCV or another library).
  - Store user information (name, photo, etc.) in the database.
  - Create a simple registration UI to input user information and capture face image.

### **Milestone 3: User Recognition and Face Comparison**
**Sprint 5: Face Recognition System**
- **Objective**: Implement face recognition using stored data.
  - Implement face recognition logic (using algorithms like Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, or deep learning methods).
  - Match live face data with stored user data in the database.
  - Test the recognition accuracy and tweak parameters for better performance.

**Sprint 6: Real-time User Recognition**
- **Objective**: Integrate face recognition into a real-time system.
  - Continuously monitor the camera for faces.
  - If a face is recognized, compare it with the database.
  - Display the user name or ID when recognition is successful.

### **Milestone 4: Enhancements and Finalization**
**Sprint 7: Error Handling and Edge Cases**
- **Objective**: Handle situations where no face is detected or the system fails to recognize a face.
  - Add error messages or feedback for non-detection or failed matches.
  - Implement retry logic or fallback options for poor lighting or unclear images.

**Sprint 8: UI/UX Finalization**
- **Objective**: Improve the user interface and user experience.
  - Create a dashboard or visual interface that displays recognized users.
  - Implement a simple log of recognized users and timestamps.
  - Optimize the interface for ease of use.

**Sprint 9: Performance Optimization**
- **Objective**: Optimize for better performance and speed.
  - Optimize face detection and recognition algorithms for faster performance on the Raspberry Pi.
  - Test system with multiple users and varying conditions to ensure robustness.
  - Adjust settings to ensure smooth operation on limited hardware resources.

### **Milestone 5: Deployment and Testing**
**Sprint 10: Full Integration Testing**
- **Objective**: Test the full system end-to-end.
  - Perform integration testing to ensure all components (camera, face detection, database, etc.) work seamlessly together.
  - Test with multiple users, different lighting conditions, and camera angles.
  - Debug and fix any issues that arise during testing.

**Sprint 11: Documentation and Final Adjustments**
- **Objective**: Complete the documentation and make any final tweaks.
  - Document the setup process, code, and how to use the system.
  - Add comments and instructions in the codebase.
  - Final checks and minor improvements based on testing feedback.

---

### **Milestone 6: Launch and Maintenance**
**Sprint 12: Deployment and Monitoring**
- **Objective**: Deploy the system and monitor its performance.
  - Deploy the system in the intended environment (e.g., a security kiosk or door access system).
  - Set up a monitoring process to ensure the system works correctly in real-life scenarios.
  - Gather feedback for future improvements or updates.
